Insight:

Sales conversion rates have dropped by 22% over the past quarter, and the average sales cycle has extended by 10 days. This indicates potential inefficiencies in our sales process and suggests that prospects require additional touchpoints before closing.

Direction:

Enhance sales follow-up strategies by implementing structured multi-touch outreach and personalized demos. Historical data suggests that leads receiving five or more personalized interactions have a 35% higher conversion rate.

Action:

Would you like to assign the sales team to implement a multi-touch follow-up strategy and track conversion improvements over the next quarter?
