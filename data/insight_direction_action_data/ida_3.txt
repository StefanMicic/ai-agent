Insight:

Product adoption among new customers has slowed by 25% in the last quarter, with a 30% decrease in engagement from users in their first 60 days. This drop suggests that our onboarding experience is not effectively driving long-term usage and may contribute to an increase in early churn.

Direction:

Launch a targeted onboarding initiative for new customers, including personalized walkthroughs and automated follow-ups. Our data shows that customers who engage with onboarding content at least three times in the first month are 40% more likely to remain active users after 90 days.

Action:

Would you like to implement a structured onboarding program with automated follow-ups to improve product adoption and engagement?
