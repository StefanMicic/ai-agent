Insight:

Customer support satisfaction scores have declined by 18% over the past six months, and our churn rate among enterprise clients has increased by 10%. This trend suggests that delays in support resolution are negatively impacting client retention and could lead to a 14% drop in enterprise revenue next quarter.

Direction:

Allocate additional resources to the support team, including upskilling existing agents and reducing response times for enterprise accounts. Our analysis indicates that enterprise clients who receive first-response resolutions within 24 hours are 30% more likely to renew their contracts.

Action:

Would you like to implement additional training for support agents and establish a 24-hour response policy for enterprise accounts to mitigate churn risk?
